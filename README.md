## About me

Hi, I'm Igor!

I'm a Platform Engineer with a strong interest in Kubernetes, observability tools, service meshes and other modern cloud-native approaches

I used to solve competitive programming contests early, then I switched my focus to algorithms and approaches behind distributed systems.
